The codes for the interactive map are in left columns. You can click the right-top blue button to launch a previewer to a separate window. The left part of the web is the map of NYC school districts. The darker the color of a district is, the higher the graduation rate of this district is. The right part of the web is two stacked bar charts showing the graduation results of a certain district of different years. The top one shows the composition of cohorts, including the rate of Graduation, Still Enrolled, Dropout, Skills & Achievement Commencement Credential (SACC) and Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC). The bottom one shows the composition of the graduation, including Advanced Regent, Regent without Advanced and Local. When your mouse hovers on a district the map, the basic information of this district in 2012 is shown in the box on the left-top corner of the map. When a district is clicked on, the stacked bar charts will change to show the information of this district. When you click on the legend of a feature below a stacked bar chart, the chart will change and show the remaining features. By this way, you can choose the specific feature you are interested in to show it in the chart.
